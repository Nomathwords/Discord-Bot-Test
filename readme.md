This is my bot that I made for fun. It's super simple, but I'd like to add more random features to it later.

How to run:

1. Install Python v3.8+
2. Clone the repo into your IDE or command line.
3. If on Windows, run the command `py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py` and `pip install discord` to install the discord.py dependencies. Also run `pip install aiofiles` for the Fortnite shop file and `python -m pip install schedule` for bot.py If on another device, run the commands `python3 -m pip install -U discord.py`, `pip install discord`, `pip install aiofiles` and `python -m pip install schedule`.
4. Install imagemagick for the OS you are using. This is used in a batch script to create the final Fortnite shop photo.
5. Place the bot key and Fortnite API key in their specific places in bot.py and br_item_shop.py.
6. If on windows, run `py -3 bot.py` to start the code and turn the bot on. If this doesn't work, try running `python3 bot.py`.
