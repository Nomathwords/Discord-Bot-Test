This is my bot that I made for fun. It's super simple, but I'd like to add more random features to it later.

How to run:

1. Clone the repo into your IDE or command line
2. Install Python v3.8+
3a. If on Windows, run the `command py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py` to install the discord.py dependencies
3b. If on another device, run the command `python3 -m pip install -U discord.py`
4a. If on windows, run `py -3 bot.py` to start the code and turn the bot on
4b. If on another device, run `python3 bot.py`

Small ideas:
1. Polls
2. Small games (Dice, Coin Flip)

Large ideas:
1. Fetch the Fortnite item shop every night
2. Fetch the new Fortnite jam tracks every Tuesday
