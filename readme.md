This is my bot that I made for fun. It's super simple, but I'd like to add more random features to it later.

How to run:

1. Clone the repo into your IDE or command line
2. Install Python v3.8+
3. a. If on Windows, run the command `py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py` and `pip install discord` to install the discord.py dependencies. Also run pip install aiofiles for the Fortnite shop file and python -m pip install schedule for bot.py
b. If on another device, run the command `python3 -m pip install -U discord.py` and `pip install discord`
4. a. If on windows, run `py -3 bot.py` to start the code and turn the bot on
b. If on another device, run `python3 bot.py`
5. Install imagemagick for the OS you are using
